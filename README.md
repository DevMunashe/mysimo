# mysimo
An offline-first minimal Farm Management Tool targeted at Small Holder Farmers. mySimo is derived from the Setswana word "Tshimo", meaning field or farm. It is in Botswana that I drew inspiration to develop the mySimo App after interacting with the small holder farming value chain for one year.
